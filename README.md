Hi, I am Danah Aldossary!

I am currently a university student with an interest in computer science and technology. I enjoy learning about programming and exploring how machine learning can be applied to solve real-world problems. Through my studies, I am building a strong foundation in software development and data-related concepts.

I am excited to learn more about machine learning and GitHub workflows in ARTI 308, and I look forward to developing my skills throughout this course.
